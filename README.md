# Sleeper Sunday Cheatsheet

Created via `create-react-app`.
11/09/2021:
- lacks any UI styling
- refactors are needed for main form
- no logic yet implemented for 'Roots' and 'Booes'

Features to add:
- compute importance based on user-input (scale league importance)
- options to sort gameday data (by position, by games, by league importance)
